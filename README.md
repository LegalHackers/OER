> [Legal Hackers](https://legalhackers.org/) is a global movement of lawyers, policymakers, designers, technologists, and academics who explore and develop creative solutions to some of the most pressing issues at the intersection of law and technology. Through local meetups, hackathons, and workshops, Legal Hackers spot issues and opportunities where technology can improve and inform the practice of law and where law, legal practice, and policy can adapt to rapidly changing technology.

* Provide space for discussion about how OER models might positively affect legal education and access to the law,
* Build a publicly available repository of OER content,
* Create a message baord/wiki for OER tools and best practices.
